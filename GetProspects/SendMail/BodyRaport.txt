Your Daily Report,

I've done my work in {3}.
Started at: {4}.
Ended at: {5}.

The filters used on my last run are listed below:
{7}
If you want to check the work I did, here are the filters inserted by me on my last run:
{8}
I will detail them now:
{6}

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ AND If you wanna know my brain:
	  The processes covered were:
	  > login in (a verify login also),
	  > selecting the filter from DB needed for me to make searches on LinkedIn,
	  // and for each filter:
	  > making a search on LinkedIn,
	  > navigating through resulted pages, scraping the prospects and inserting them into DB.

From Roberto,
Kind Regards!
